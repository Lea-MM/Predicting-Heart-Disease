# Predicting Heart Disease 💓

This project focuses on **building a predictive model** to assess the likelihood of a patient developing **heart disease** in the future based on medical data. The dataset contains anonymized patient information and includes several features that are key indicators of heart health. The task involves cleaning the data, performing **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify relevant features, and training a **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier. Hyperparameter tuning will be applied to optimize the model's performance for accurate predictions. This project demonstrates expertise in **data preparation**, **feature selection**, **model training**, and **evaluation**, all with a focus on **healthcare applications**.

### 🏆 Objective:
Develop a **K Nearest Neighbors** classifier to predict the **risk of heart disease** based on medical data, showcasing proficiency in data preparation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

### 🧑‍⚕️ Dataset Information:  
The dataset contains several important features that are critical to predicting heart disease:

- **Age**: Age of the patient (in years)
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient (M: Male, F: Female)
- **ChestPainType**: Type of chest pain (TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic)
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol level (in mm/dl)
- **FastingBS**: Fasting blood sugar (1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise)
- **RestingECG**: Resting electrocardiogram results (Normal: Normal, ST: ST-T wave abnormality, LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric value between 60 and 202)
- **ExerciseAngina**: Exercise-induced angina (Y: Yes, N: No)
- **Oldpeak**: Depression of the ST segment (Numeric value)
- **ST_Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping)
- **HeartDisease**: Output class (1: heart disease, 0: Normal)
