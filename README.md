# Predicting-Heart-Disease
This project involves building a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a patient developing heart disease in the future based on medical data. The dataset contains anonymized patient information and includes various features related to heart health. The task is to clean the data, conduct exploratory data analysis to identify relevant features, and train a K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The model will be optimized through hyperparameter tuning to accurately predict the risk of heart disease. This project showcases skills in data preparation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation, with a focus on healthcare applications.

Objective:  
Develop a K Nearest Neighbors classifier to predict the risk of heart disease based on medical data, demonstrating proficiency in data preparation, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

### Dataset Information:  
The dataset contains several features relevant to predicting the likelihood of heart disease, including:

- **Age**: Age of the patient (in years)
- **Sex**: Sex of the patient (M: Male, F: Female)
- **ChestPainType**: Type of chest pain (TA: Typical Angina, ATA: Atypical Angina, NAP: Non-Anginal Pain, ASY: Asymptomatic)
- **RestingBP**: Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
- **Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol level (in mm/dl)
- **FastingBS**: Fasting blood sugar (1: if FastingBS > 120 mg/dl, 0: otherwise)
- **RestingECG**: Resting electrocardiogram results (Normal: Normal, ST: ST-T wave abnormality, LVH: Left ventricular hypertrophy)
- **MaxHR**: Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric value between 60 and 202)
- **ExerciseAngina**: Exercise-induced angina (Y: Yes, N: No)
- **Oldpeak**: Depression of the ST segment (Numeric value)
- **ST_Slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Up: upsloping, Flat: flat, Down: downsloping)
- **HeartDisease**: Output class (1: heart disease, 0: Normal)
